#  Semantic-gap-oriented feature selection in hierarchical classification learning (HFSLE)
* HFSLE is realized by matlab code.
* Algorithm function: HFSLE.m 
* Test processes: HierKNNPredictionBatch.m
* HFSLE is compared with several hierarchical feature selection methods, such as: HFisher, HmRMR, HSDFS, HIFSRR, HFSDK.

## Prerequisite
* matlab2016a

## How to use
* run mainKNN.m
