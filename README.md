#  Semantic-gap-oriented feature selection in hierarchical classification learning(HFSLE)
HFSLE is realized by matlab code. Algorithm function: HFSLE.m test processes:HierKNNPredictionBatch.m

HFSLE is compared with several hierarchical feature selection methods, such as: HFisher, HmRMR, HSDFS, HIFSRR, HFSDK

## Prerequisite
* matlab2016a

## How to use
run mainKNN.m
